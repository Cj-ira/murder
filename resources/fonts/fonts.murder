# Hi there! If you want to load .ttf fonts use the following format:
# <index> <path-to-font>: <font-size>
# For example: 
#   100 FontName.ttf: 16
#
# You can access your font in Murder according to the index you chose. Remember that some indices (100+) are reserved 
# for the built-in engine fonts!
# Empty lines, or starting with '#' are ignored.

100 ChevyRay-Pinch.ttf: 7
101 ChevyRay-MagicBook.ttf: 12
